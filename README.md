# Compo an ERBV Playground

A playground Rails application for exploring component style view architecture with ERB files.

## Why?

There are several good Ruby based View Component gems available, but it feels nice just to keep within the ERB.

### ERBV Aims to: 

- Get back to HTML & CSS. (Generating HTML from a Ruby Class alienates FE devs).
- Borrow some of the nice co-location architecture for Vue/React.
- Provide a modern CSS first themeable components without scoping the component to death with CSS classes.

## Usage

- Install ruby 3.3.0
- `bundle` 
- `rails s`
